# 15Puzzle
This solves the 15Puzzle Problem that can be viewed here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle#:~:text=The%2015%20puzzle%20 utilizing different means and heuristics. The different methods are as follows: 
<br>
BFS- Breadth First Search <br>
DFS - Depth First Search <br>
Astar - Heuristic based Greedy Search <br>
IDAstar - Iteratively Deepening Heuristic Based Greedy Search <br>
To run the program simply use your preferred  C++ compiler to compile the program and then run with the arguments being the configuration of board wanted with '0' indicating the empty space. <br>
EG: <br>
g++ BFS.cpp <br>
./a.out 5 2 4 8 10 3 11 14 6 0 9 12 13 1 15 7
